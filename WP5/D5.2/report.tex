\section{Introduction}

The aim of this project is to optimize the overall performance of Cython code
that uses Numpy arrays.

Indeed, when operations are done on Numpy arrays, Cython relies on the original
Numpy package to compute them. This involves a fall back to the Python
interpreter. It thus misses several optimisation opportunities, especially with
complex expressions.

The Pythran project is a Python to C++ compiler, that aims at optimizing
scientific Python. It thus supports only a subset of the Python language.
It also has a full C++ implementation of a major set of the Numpy API. Some of
the advantage of this implementation is that it supports expression templates
and SIMD instructions. Expression templates allow to "fuse" loops that can
occurs when expressions with multiple operators are computed. For instance,
the expression $a+b*c$ will original be transformed by Cython in two call: one
for the multiplication of $b$ by $c$, and one for the addition of the result of
this multiplication and the addition by $a$. Each call will end-up in one loop,
that will read memory, compute the operation and write back to memory. The
second loop will have the same pattern. In nowadays architecture, memory
bandwidth is often the limiting factor in this kind of operation. It is thus
really interesting to merge these loops, and load/store the memory only once.
Expression templating is a C++ technique that allows to evaluate expressions
only when they are stored to memory. Thus, in this case, the two loops will be
automatically "merged" by the C++ compiler, and we'll get an optimized version
of this code. Note that this technique is used for instance by the C++ wrapper
of the GMP library.

\section{Cython and Pythran integration}

The project has been focused on using this Pythran backend for numpy arrays in
Cython when possible. Indeed, Pythran has a few limitations regarding the numpy
arrays it can handle:

\begin{itemize}
  \item array "views" are not supported. That means that arrays must be stored
    in conitguous memory. Fortran and C-style format are supported.
  \item the endianess of the integers must be the same that the one of the
    targeted architecture (note that Cython has the same limitation)
\end{itemize}

We thus need to be able to fall-back to the Cython implementation if we are not
in one of those cases.

The integration within Cython works this way:

\begin{itemize}
  \item at the function level, for every argument that is an numpy array and
    supported by Pythran, we change its type by a fused type
    \footnote{\url{http://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/fusedtypes.html}}.
    This fused type is whether a Pythran numpy buffer or the original Cython
    buffer type
  \item for variable defined as numpy array, we change them directly to a
    Pythran buffer, if their type and endianess are supported.
\end{itemize}

Cython has a comprehensive suite test regarding the Numpy features it supports.
This test suite is still valid after this integration.

\section{Usage}

A new flag {\tt --np-pythran} has been added to Cython that enables the usage
of Pythran for Numpy operations. It will generate a C++ file that uses the
optimized Numpy functions that are in Pythran.

Then, when compiling the final extension, a path to an existing Pythran
installation must be provided.

Here is an example of usage using {\tt distutils}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
from distutils.core import setup
from Cython.Build import cythonize

setup(
    name = "My hello app",
    ext_modules = cythonize('hello_pythran.pyx', np_pythran=True)
)
\end{lstlisting}

Basically, a flag {\tt np\_pythran} has been added to the {\tt cythonize} call
that will enable the usage of the Pythran backend. It needs to have the Pythran
module installed.

\section{Benchmarks}

We did some benchmarks to see the benefits of the Pythran integration for Numpy
operations. These benchmarks have been done using an Intel Core i7-6700HQ.

\subsection{Float computation}

Here is a code snippet that does some computation on floating-point values:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
import numpy
cimport numpy
def float_comp(numpy.ndarray[numpy.float_t, ndim=1] a, \
             numpy.ndarray[numpy.float_t, ndim=1] b):
    return numpy.sqrt(numpy.sqrt(a*a+b*b))
\end{lstlisting}

The figure~\ref{fig:float_bench} shows the compute time for various sizes for
{\tt a} and {\tt b}, using the original Cython mode, then Cython with the
Pythran backend, and finally Cython with the Pythran backend and SIMD
instructions.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{\label{fig:float_bench} Float computation benchmark (logarithmic scales)}
  \includegraphics{benchs/float/graph.pdf}
\end{figure}

For instance, for $N = 1000000$, we have a speedup of ~2.4x using the Pythran
backend (against the original Cython version), and ~3.7x using SIMD
instructions (still against the original Cython version).

\subsection{Harris}

This benchmark is based on the code available here:
\url{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serge-sans-paille/numpy-benchmarks/master/benchmarks/harris.py}.

The adapted Cython code is the following:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
import numpy
cimport numpy

def harris(numpy.ndarray[numpy.float_t, ndim=2] I):
  cdef int m = I.shape[0]
  cdef int n = I.shape[1]
  cdef numpy.ndarray[numpy.float_t, ndim=2] dx = \
    (I[1:, :] - I[:m-1, :])[:, 1:]
  cdef numpy.ndarray[numpy.float_t, ndim=2] dy = \
    (I[:, 1:] - I[:, :n-1])[1:, :]

  cdef numpy.ndarray[numpy.float_t, ndim=2] A = dx * dx
  cdef numpy.ndarray[numpy.float_t, ndim=2] B = dy * dy
  cdef numpy.ndarray[numpy.float_t, ndim=2] C = dx * dy
  cdef numpy.ndarray[numpy.float_t, ndim=2] tr = A + B
  cdef numpy.ndarray[numpy.float_t, ndim=2] det = A * B - C * C
  return det - tr * tr
\end{lstlisting}

The figure~\ref{fig:harris_bench} shows the compute time for various sizes of
the 2D array I ($N \times N$). We've got a ~25 \% improvement with an array of
$4096 \times 4096$ floats as input using the Pythran backend. Moreover, in this
case, it seems that this code does not really benefits from SIMD instructions.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{\label{fig:harris_bench} Harris computation benchmark}
  \includegraphics{benchs/harris/graph.pdf}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Convolution}

We used this example from the Cython documentation:
\url{http://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/numpy.html}.

The input we use is the following:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
import numpy as np
N = 1000
f = np.arange(N*N, dtype=np.int).reshape((N,N))
g = np.arange(81, dtype=np.int).reshape((9, 9))
\end{lstlisting}

The results are the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item for the classical Cython version: 155ms
  \item for the Cython version using the Pythran backend: 150ms
  \item for the Cython version using the Pythran backend using SIMD instructions: 149ms
\end{itemize}

It seems the Pythran backend don't manage to benefit a lot from SIMD
instructions in this case. We thus still got an average speedup of ~3 \%.
